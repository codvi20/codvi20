# Mathematical questions

## Which are the desired values for parameters?
For the different answers in the [social](open-social-questions.md) questions
list related to time and distance to consider a "proximity", the parameters
will offer different degrees of probability to cover them.

The question is: which is the model these paremeters follow?
Thus, how can, if I give these two numbers (time and distance to consider
"proximity"), which are the optimum paremeters?

## Simulate the app
A good open question is to simulate different scenarios with different values
of parameters and different models of virus spreading.
